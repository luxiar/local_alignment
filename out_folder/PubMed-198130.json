{"text":"Magnitude of malate-aspartate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide shuttle activity in intact respiring tumor cells.\nMeasurements of respiration, CO2 and lactate production, and changes in the levels of various key metabolites of the glycolytic sequence and tricarboxylic acid cycle were made on five lines of rodent ascites tumor cells (two strains of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, Krebs II carcinoma, AS-30D carcinoma, and L1210 cells) incubated aerobically in the presence of uniformly labeled D-[14C]glucose. From these data, as well as earlier evidence demonstrating that the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) shuttle in these cells requires a transaminase step and is thus identified as the malate-aspartate shuttle (W.V.V. Greenhouse and A.L. Lehninger, Cancer Res., 36: 1392-1396, 1976), metabolic flux diagrams were constructed for the five cell lines. These diagrams show the relative rates of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transport, and the malate-aspartate shuttle in these tumors. Large amounts of cytosolic NADH were oxidized by the mitochondrial respiratory chain via the NADH shuttle, comprising anywhere from about 20 to 80% of the total flow of reducing equivalents to oxygen in these tumors. Calculations of the sources of energy for adenosine triphosphate synthesis indicated that on the average about one-third of the respiratory adenosine triphosphate is generated by electron flow originating from cytosolic NADH via the malate-aspartate shuttle.","sourcedb":"PubMed","sourceid":"198130","divid":0,"section":"TIAB","source_url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/198130","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":22,"end":80},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":118,"end":129},"obj":"Cell"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":161,"end":164},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":169,"end":176},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":273,"end":291},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":325,"end":331},"obj":"Organism"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":332,"end":351},"obj":"Cell"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":368,"end":395},"obj":"Cell"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":397,"end":415},"obj":"Cell"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":417,"end":433},"obj":"Cell"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":439,"end":450},"obj":"Cell"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":511,"end":525},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":603,"end":636},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":638,"end":642},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":661,"end":666},"obj":"Cell"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":726,"end":732},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":733,"end":742},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":879,"end":889},"obj":"Cell"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":949,"end":967},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":975,"end":983},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1003,"end":1009},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1010,"end":1019},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1037,"end":1043},"obj":"Cancer"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1072,"end":1076},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1111},"obj":"Cellular_component"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1142},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1238,"end":1244},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1254,"end":1260},"obj":"Cancer"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1304,"end":1326},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1402,"end":1424},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1441,"end":1449},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1472,"end":1481},"obj":"Cellular_component"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1482,"end":1486},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1495,"end":1501},"obj":"Simple_chemical"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1502,"end":1511},"obj":"Simple_chemical"}]}
